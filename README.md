A collection of examples and tutorials on how to use Runway with [OpenRNDR](https://openrndr.org/).

## OPENRNDR/RunwayML Pose example

![](images/example.png)

This is a simple implementation of [OpenRNDR](http://https://openrndr.org) integrating with the [PoseNet model](https://github.com/runwayml/processing/blob/master/posenet/posenet.pde). It uses SocketIO to listen for emitted events and renders the ensuing implemented poses, similar to the [Processing.org implementation](https://github.com/runwayml/processing).
